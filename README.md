# sports_analytics
A collection of my sports-related coding projects

## :woman_technologist:  About me
Stats classes and research projects at uni sparked my interest for data analytics and finally brought me to the world of IT. Having an educational background in business and sports management, I basically started from scratch when I joined an IT consultancy after finishing my studies 2.5 years ago. Today, I’m working as a Tableau developer and Data Engineer. Creating Tableau dashboards for clients of various industries and preparing the data using SQL and PySpark are my main responsibilities. <br/> Eager to grow my tech skills, I decided to enhance my Python skills and therefore started to work on different coding projects in my spare time. I strongly believe that having more fun makes you more successful, that’s why I decided to work on projects related to sports analytics - an area that I could not be more enthusiastic about. In this GitHub repo, I’m going to showcase my work.
